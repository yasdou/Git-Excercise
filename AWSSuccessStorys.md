## Who is Tier
- originally electric scooter company
- now full micromobility fleet
> mission: “change mobility for good”

## Challenges
- streamline battery swapping
- stability of the App (connection between users-servers-scooter)
- traditional model of operating and maintaining scooters costs too much

## Innovations & Solutions
- of the shelf AWS Solutions (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)
    - Develop the Backend locally and when pushed to production it´s the same execution environment
- AWS IoT Greengrass
    - service running on the scooter communicating with cloud when needed and tells Tier when the battery should be swapped

## Result 
> “This results in all kinds of side benefits for the customer, such as better prices, more scooters, and higher availability,”
- Expects reduction of operational costs by a factor of 10
- Facilitates an expected software deployment frequency of 50 times per week per team
- Sharpened focus on development instead of infrastructure
- Maintains scooter function with little to no network connectivity
