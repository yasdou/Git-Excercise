### Exam Prep
- an infrastucture is <b> highly available </b> if even in the event that some compnents fail it is still able to provide normal service with very high probability 
    - aws -> even if one AZ goes down there will very likely be another one that can take over
- an infrastructure is <b>highly scalable</b> if the system is able to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system.
- <b>fault-tolerance</b> is how much faults you are able to tolerate for your service (for aws mostly you are not fault tolerant at all. Thats why you use the cloud) 

VPC Peering

## Git
- Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
- It tracks changes to files and directories over time, allowing developers to view, compare, and revert changes easily.
- Git provides a way to collaborate and share code between team members through the use of branches and merge requests.
- It allows developers to work offline, making it possible to work on code without an internet connection.
- Git has a powerful command-line interface, as well as several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that simplify its use.
- Git stores data in a compressed format, making it efficient in terms of storage space and network usage.
- Git provides a mechanism for code review and collaboration through the use of pull requests, allowing team members to review and discuss changes before merging them.
- Git can be integrated with other development tools and services, such as continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) systems.
- Git is used by millions of developers around the world and is an essential tool for modern software development workflows.

## AWS Cloudformation
- AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources and applications using code, in the form of templates.
- CloudFormation templates are written in YAML or JSON format and are used to create a "stack" of resources in the AWS Cloud, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.
- CloudFormation is a declarative language, meaning you specify the desired state of your infrastructure, and CloudFormation handles the provisioning and configuration of the resources to reach that state.
- Templates can be version-controlled and shared, allowing for easy collaboration among team members and repeatability of infrastructure.
- CloudFormation templates can be parameterized, allowing you to specify variables at runtime, making it easy to reuse templates across environments or applications.
- CloudFormation provides an audit trail of changes to your infrastructure, allowing you to track changes over time.
CloudFormation allows you to use AWS best practices, such as infrastructure as code, automation, and security, to provision and manage your infrastructure resources.
- CloudFormation can be used to manage updates to your infrastructure, allowing you to make changes to your templates and update your stack in a controlled and repeatable manner.
- CloudFormation is a scalable and reliable service, capable of handling large and complex stacks, with support for rollback in case of errors or failures during stack creation or updates.
- Terraform is a system that allows creating templates for different cloud systems in one go
